# Calendar
Project builded using NextJS.
# Roles:
Manager and Trainer

The main idea is to make a calendar where the manager can create events for ordinary users. Trainers can join these events

# Install - yarn install

# Run in localhost - yarn dev

Lab3:
Fixed bug in program-blocks.tsx(where triggered useEffect hook and user cannot switch program block). Fixes button "Create trainer"(where after click to this button user dont see anything, now data is refreshing). Also changed backrouund in events(where was transparent background - now it is gray)
